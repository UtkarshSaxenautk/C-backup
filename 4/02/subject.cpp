/*(Compute total marks for each student) Suppose the marks obtained by all students 
are stored in a two-dimensional array. Each row records a studentâ€™s marks for five 
tests. For example, the following array stores the test marks for eight students. 
Write a program that displays students and the total marks they obtained in five 
tests, in decreasing order of the total marks.
Enter a 4-by-4 matrix row by row: 
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 */
